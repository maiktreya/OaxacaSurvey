# Package OaxacaSurvey 0.1

an r test package implementing the oaxaca-blinder decomposition for survey objects, that is, taking sample weights into consideration by means of svyglm superset of standard glm implemented in package *Survey*.

--------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------

### Installation and usage

Install latest version from:

```r
devtools::install_github("maiktreya/OaxacaSurvey)
```
#' @param formula An object of class formula: the model formula.
#' @param data A data frame: containing the variables in the formula, group, and weights.
#' @param group A character string: the name of the binary group variable in the data. 1 for the first group, and 0 for the second group.
#' @param weights A character string: the name of the weights variable in the data.
#' @param R An integer: the number of bootstrap replicates. Default is 1000.
#' @param conf.level A float less than 1: Confidence level for estimated CI.
#' @param method String: one between "normal" (default) or "logit" for logistic models
The only implemented method to perform the decomposition is *oaxaca_blinder_svy*. It performs Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition for 2 groups of controls from a survey with sampling weigths. The function uses the following parameters:

- **@param formula** *An object of class formula:* the model formula.
- **@param data** *A data frame:* containing the variables in the formula, group, and weights.
- **@param group** *A character string:* the name of the binary group variable in the data. 1 for the first group, and 0 for the second group.
- **@param weights** *A character string:* the name of the weights variable in the data.
- **@param R** *An integer:* the number of bootstrap replicates. Default is 1000.
- **@param conf.level** *A float less than 1:* Confidence level for estimated CI.
- **@param method** *String:* one between "normal" (default) or "logit" for logistic models.

A working example can be run pointing to the following project path:

```r
source("tests/examples.R")
```

### Underlying logic

Let's assume we have a linear model of the general form:

$$ {Y} = \hat\beta_{0}  +  \hat\beta_{1} {X} + u $$

Where two distinct groups, let say 1 & 2, sharing certain characteristics, could be subsampled and estimated individually in the form of:

$$ Y_1 = \hat\beta_{01}  +  \hat\beta_{1} {X}_1 + u $$

$$ Y_2 = \hat\beta_{02}  +  \hat\beta_{1} {X}_2 + u $$

After this first step estimation and assuming the mean difference on the endogenous variable for the groups is by definition:

$$ \Delta \bar{Y} = \bar{Y}_1 - \bar{Y}_2  $$

We then could rearrange both models together to build the so called Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition. The Decomposition computed is the so-called "triple" (even "quadruple" if we also consider the "Unexplained" remainder):

$$ \Delta Y = U + E + C + I \ $$

For:

- $\Delta Y$ is the mean difference in the outcome variable between the two groups.
- $U$ is the unexplained remainder (difference of model intercepts, usually omitted).
- $E$ represents the endowments effect.
- $C$ represents the coefficients effect.
- $I$ represents the interaction effect.

The difference in mean outcomes between the two groups can be expressed as:

$$ \Delta \bar{Y} = (\hat\beta_{01} - \hat\beta_{02}) + (\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2) \hat{\beta}_2 + \bar{X}_2 (\hat{\beta}_1 - \hat{\beta}_2) + (\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2) (\hat{\beta}_1 - \hat{\beta}_2) $$

Where:

- $\Delta \bar{Y}$ is the difference in mean outcomes between group 1 and group 2.
- $\hat\beta_{01}$ and $\hat\beta_{02}$ are the estimated intercepts for group 1 and group 2, respectively.
- $\bar{X}_1$ and $\bar{X}_2$ are the mean values of the covariates for group 1 and group 2, respectively.
- $\hat{\beta}_1$ and $\hat{\beta}_2$ are the estimated coefficients for group 1 and group 2, respectively.

The three terms on the right side represent the contributions from differences in unexplained (U), endowments (E), coefficients (C), and interaction effects (I).
